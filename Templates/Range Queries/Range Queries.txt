Types of problems
1. Given array A[A1,A2,A3,....An] find answer for some range [L,R] where 0<=L,R<=N
2.Types of queries
    a.offline queries- You will know all queries at the begining e.g [2,5],[3,8],[5,8] so precomputation like prefix sum in range sum would be helpful
    b.online queries- 
        i.Need to answer queries one by one and dont have access to next queries untill you answer current query e.g. [2,5]->answer this query->[3,8]
        ii.In Online queries one variation could be [2,5] gives a then for next query make it [3+a,8+a] thats why the name online queries
        iii. Updates can be point Updates or range Updates
3.PREFIX SUM Implementation already covered.
    a.works only for invertible functions like +,-,/,* e.g x+y=10 for x=5 we know y will be 5 but max,min functions are not invertible
4.Segment Trees(point and range Updates)
5.Fenwick Trees
6.MO's Algorithm(arrays and trees)
7.Square Root Decomposition
8.Sparse table
