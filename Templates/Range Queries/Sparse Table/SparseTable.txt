1.Sparse Table is a data structure, that allows answering range queries. 
2.Advatages
    a.It can answer most range queries in O(logN).
    b.but its true power is answering range minimum queries (or equivalent range maximum queries). For those queries it can compute the answer in O(1)
3.Disadvantages
    a.The only drawback of this data structure is, that it can only be used on immutable arrays. This means, that the array cannot be changed between two queries. 
    b.If any element in the array changes, the complete data structure has to be recomputed.


# What is sparese Table
    1. dp[i][j] -> answer to query [i,i+ (2^j)-1]

# How can it anser range queries
    1.Range Sum queries?
        ->[L,R] is the range [L,L+W] where W=R-L
        ->W can be written as binary number. e.g if w=45 then w=(101101) in binary
    2.any range of size w can be broken into <= log(W) ranges
    3.For above example we can answer 
        ->sum(L,R)=Table[L][5] + Table[L1][3] + Table[L2][2] + Table[L3][0] 

# How to build it
  ->Dynamic Programming
  ->states
    ->dp(i,j) means range starting from i and ends with i+(2^j)-1 and it is power of 2 so if we divide this range into 2 equal parts with width 2^(j-1)
    ->dp(i,j)= dp(i,j-1)+dp(i+(2^j),j-1)
    

# Range Min/Max queries in O(1) time
    ->min(L,R)= min( min(L,R-1), min(L+2,R))


# How to find greatest power of 2 less than W=L-R
    -> take algorithm as log(W)=x implies w=2^x
    -> can be calulated using bitwise left shift tricks 2^j = (1<<j)
